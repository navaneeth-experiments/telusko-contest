Q) Print Pascal's triangle with the following approaches:
  - Iterative.
  - Recursive.
  - Memoization.


Before diving into code first let's try to undestand what is pascal's triangle. 

### What is pascal's triangle?
pascal's triangle is a triangle of numbers as shown below which start with 1 and also every row starts and ends with 1.<br/>
<pre>
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
</pre>

 Try to observe the above triangle in rows. It has 4 rows. where
 - 1st Row has one number that is 1
 - 2nd row has two numbers that is 1, 1
 - 3rd row has 3 numbers(1, 2, 1) where 2(middle number) is the sum of it's above numbers(1, 1). 
 - 4th row has 4 numbers(1, 3, 3, 1) where first 3, second number in the row is the sum of it's above numbers(1, 2) and second 3, third number in the row is the sum of it's above numbers(2, 1).
 
 So, finally we can say pascal's triangle is a triangle of numbers which looks like below said points:
 - starts with 1
 - Each row in the triangle starts and ends with 1 and the other numbers in the triangle will be the sum of it's above numbers.

Hope it's clear until here ðŸš€

Now let's reimagine the same pascal's triangle with some mathematics as shown below.
<pre>
         0C0
      1C0    1C1
   2C0    2C1   2C2
3C0    3C1    3C2   3C3
</pre>
